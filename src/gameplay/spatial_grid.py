"""Uniform spatial hash grid for fast neighbour / overlap queries.

Buckets objects (anything exposing a `.rect`) into fixed-size cells so a query
only inspects nearby cells instead of every object. This turns the O(N^2)
all-pairs scans (mob-vs-mob avoidance, entity-vs-walls collision) into roughly
O(N): each lookup touches only the handful of objects in adjacent cells.

Rebuild it each frame for moving objects (mobs); build it once for static
objects (walls).
