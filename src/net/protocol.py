"""Wire protocol: framing + (de)serialization, in ONE place.

This module knows nothing about games, players, rooms, or GUIs. It only knows
how to put a Python message onto a TCP stream and read it back out. Both the
client and the server transports build on it, so the framing logic that is
currently copy-pasted in client.py / server.py / network.py lives here exactly
once.

Wire format for every message:

    [ 4-byte big-endian unsigned length ][ <length> bytes of serialized body ]

The body codec is pluggable (see `Codec`). The default is JSON, which is safe
to read from an untrusted peer. Pickle is offered too, but read the warning on
`PickleCodec` before you reach for it.
