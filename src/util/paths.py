"""Filesystem anchors that work both from source and inside a PyInstaller bundle.

The game loads `assets/` and `config/` with paths relative to the current
working directory (e.g. ``game.py`` opens ``"config/assets.yaml"``). That only
holds when the process runs from the project root.

When PyInstaller freezes the desktop client, data files bundled via
``standoff.spec``'s ``datas`` are unpacked next to the executable (onedir) or
extracted to a temp dir (onefile); either way their location is exposed as
``sys._MEIPASS``. To keep the existing relative paths valid in both modes,
``__main__`` chdirs into :func:`resource_root` at startup.

Not used by ``main.py`` (the Android/buildozer entry point) — python-for-android
runs from the packaged app directory directly, so cwd-relative paths already
resolve there without help.
